An efficient unit converter with a console interface, built using .NET and C#. This application converts length, tempearture, volume, and weight between metric and imperial.<br/><br/>
You can test the console application at <a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/CsTjUv">https://dotnetfiddle.net/CsTjUv</a> or by clicking the image below.

## Future Plans
If I have time to come back to this project, I plan to add the following features:
- **Volume Conversions**: Converting from gallons to liters to cubic inches.
- **Weight Conversions**: Converting from ounces to grams.
- **Update Console Interface**: Make the interface more user friendly using the Spectre.Console library.

## Reflections

I like the method that I came up with for efficient conversions between metric and imperial units, but I still came across issues with types. In hindsight, I should have created an interface, but I was too far along with the console application to go back and refactor within my timeline for the project.
